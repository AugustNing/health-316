Our goal is to provide a user friendly way for users to get aggregate information about various conditions. We will merge health data from several sources such as the IHME, CDC, and Enigma. The queries are informational, so you would be filtering down based on location, demographic, or other relevant data point information. For example, you might be curious about the number of male adults above age 65 who were affected by malaria in low income countries. One area where data could be updated would be null values - where we simply lack the information, but that information could be gathered. Additional updates could be insertion of new years and disease metrics.
